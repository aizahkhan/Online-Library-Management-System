In my C++ programming class, I developed an Online Library Management System for a Martian library. As the establishment of a library on Mars marks a significant cultural milestone, the challenge of transporting physical books necessitated the creation of a digital system. This system was designed to manage and track virtual books and users, allowing Martian residents to browse the library's collection, check in and out books, and reserve titles for electronic delivery. The project leveraged object-oriented programming principles to build a robust and scalable system that could meet the unique needs of a Martian society.
